# Strategy & Infrastructure

### Overview
The ALANA Strategy & Infrastructure working group is primarily concerned with researching, designing, and developing robust infrastructure around the project and our community to ensure its longevity, continuous decentralization, and circular economy.

### Organizational Design


### Tools & Resources


### Token Engineering

Since the beginning of The ALANA Project, we have been determined to continuously decentralize the project and build a token economy around it to guarantee its longevity. But we were missing three important factors, which I am listing in the chronological order we have tackled them over the past two years:

1. very clear alignment among community members about what we are here to do.
2. We had to gain sufficient knowledge about the design process of a token economy. We did this by joining the Token Engineering Academy and completing all but one module successfully.
3. We had to establish and vote on an organizational structure that enabled fairness and equality based on contribution, not financial investment.
