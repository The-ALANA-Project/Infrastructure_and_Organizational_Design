# Strategy & Infrastructure
<br/>

### Overview
The ALANA Strategy & Infrastructure working group is primarily concerned with researching, designing, and developing robust infrastructure around the project and our community to ensure its longevity, continuous decentralization, and circular economy.
<br/>
<br/>

### Organizational Design
Originally, stellaachenbach (founder) created ALANA as a 3D avatar to give a face to the Web3 Revolution. As ALANA grew more popular among fellow designers and creators, stellaachenbach decided to utilize this attraction to evolve the once personal project into something more meaningful. Since then, and with the support of many contributors and partners, it has transitioned from a very centralized project to a continuously decentralized one run by various members of ALANA's community. 
To learn more about the project and how we are organized, we suggest the following:
- **[Take the Web3 LEARNER Journey](https://zealy.io/cw/thealanaproject):** A gamified learner journey that helps with gaining some basic knowledge about Web3 and the ALANA Community.
- **[Understand our Value Alignment](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?id=ed49cb2f-536c-45c6-9232-101abdad33b8):** Read and mint the ALANA Manifesto and understand which values we hold up high.
- **[Mint an Executive Summary about the Work we do](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?id=8f65c770-38a2-4e4e-ac20-7afd37da0525):** The ALANA Codex is a summary of all the meetings we do on a weekly basis. Once you connect with the NFT minted to [Darkblock.io](https://www.darkblock.io/), you will see even more than the sheet summary, such as screenshots, work-in-progress images, etc.
<br/>
ALANA's Manifesto is the base NFT for gaining access to community channels and interactions ( *access criteria coming soon* ). For those who seek to join on a more serious basis, there are three different levels of memberships we have composed and voted on:

### Token Engineering

Since the beginning of The ALANA Project, we have been determined to continuously decentralize the project and build a token economy around it to guarantee its longevity. But we were missing three important factors:

1. A cohesive branding from the former personal project to one that encapsulates and represents the community. You can find the successfully developed Branding Guidelines [here](https://github.com/The-ALANA-Project/Brand_Identity_and_Socials).
2. We had to gain sufficient knowledge about the design process of a token economy. We did this by joining the Token Engineering Academy and completing most of the available modules. An example here is the [public profile of founder stellaachenbach](https://tokenengineering.net/user/6347fcfcca6f14ab120b0049/).
3. We had to establish and vote on an organizational structure that enabled fairness and equality based on contribution, not financial investment. As mentioned above, we did so by designing various tools that promote transparency and meticulously defining stakeholder roles. 

Over the past two years, we have worked hard and successfully on all three factors and started in Q2 of this year with our token evaluation. We know several Web3-based projects have failed due to badly designed Tokenomics, so we are taking an appropriate amount of time to work through a detailed process. With our acquired token engineering skills (three team members have attended the Token Engineering Academy successfully), we are carefully evaluating the token along the [Tokenomics Design Canvas](https://tokenomics-guide.notion.site/Tokenomics-Design-Canvas-9b15bbd593504e9cbb91f82f95f75ca9).

However, throughout the evaluation process, we became aware that more common token models share a strong focus on being used within an AMM (automated market maker)/ DeFi-related applications. Since The Alana Project is oriented toward educational empowerment and aims to foster intrinsic motivation, we had to adjust several components and develop tools on top. We want to avoid that our designed system tips the balance and ensures that only active contributions are valued.

In a nutshell, The Alana Project aims to bridge the aforementioned gap by developing a Tokenomics model for a Web3-empowered community project that is advancing token engineering through three key pillars: 
- **KPI-based Token Emission Schedule:** As mentioned above, the $ALANA token is meant to be a reward (payment) for all active contributors in the value creation process. It is an incentive to stimulate work and activity across a dispersed group of people who maintain the integrity of the project and create products all aligned with the mission and vision. Therefore, fixed emissions or built-in mechanisms to increase the token supply may not align with the project's purpose. This problem led us to ask how contributions can be measured if contributed by different actors and for various tasks. How can we capture performance, impact, and growth from a single contribution and in balance with those of others? Our proposed solution is called [“Contribution Calculator”]() (ongoing work in progress), a tool that correlates the individual work input into points, which will be used to determine and calculate the amount of $ALANA token a contributor can claim at the end of a season. In consequence, this requires a KPI-based token emission schedule. On the demand side, the $Alana token is influenced by the number of customers that either use the token or hold it.  

Regarding the governance arena, most discussions in the current ecosystem are centered around token concentration and token price, with resources and motivations dispersed across various stakeholders. This leads to governance discussions, and the difficult task to balance between financial power (in connection to token based voting), expert power of the core team (in connection to agenda setting), and the inclusion rights of creators and other stakeholders. 

Since the Alana project is meant to be a platform from creators for creators, we do not want investors or speculators to gain significant governance rights by simple token accumulation. From a token engineering perspective, the question to be solved is twofold: How can we implement a governance mechanism that safeguards the influence of creators and contributors on the one hand (governance token), while implementing a token that is tradeable and can be used as a means of payment for the products and services that the Alana project offers (utility token). 

Our basic idea to solve this is a separation between the $Alana token and a membership NFT with governance rights. To get a membership NFT, one has to do a kind of “proof-of-work” in the form of active contributions to the project and/or products. This membership NFT comes with different governance rights (defining the decision space) in accordance with the role that a contributor plays inside the Alana project. Furthermore, this NFT can be infused by staking the $Alana token, leading to more voting rights in connection to the distinguished role. The aim is to build a community-driven platform that fosters collaboration, sharing of best practices, and collective problem-solving among token creators and contributors as well as users and stakeholders.

### Tools & Resources
Some of the tools we have already developed and want to adjust for other communities to generically and freely use are:
- [**The ALANA Codex**](https://app.unlock-protocol.com/checkout?id=8f65c770-38a2-4e4e-ac20-7afd37da0525): An executive summary of all the meetings we do on a weekly basis (sheet summary, such as screenshots, work-in-progress images, etc.) and entirely web3-powered by utilizing Unlock Protocol in conjunction with [Darkblock.io](https://www.darkblock.io/). 
- [**The ALANA Manifesto - 10 Principles of a Good Community**](https://www.heurio.co/dieter-rams-10-principles-of-good-design): A clearly designed value structure in the form of a Manifesto to ensure internal alignment that is communicated to new members.
- [**ALANA's Hot Seat**](https://alanas-hot-seat.my.canva.site/non-hierarchical-coaching-initiative): A non-hierarchical coaching initiative that works peer-to-peer and means to foster a sense of belonging, while encouraging personal and professional growth within a community.
