# Strategy & Infrastructure

### Overview
The ALANA Strategy & Infrastructure working group is primarily concerned with researching, designing, and developing robust infrastructure around the project and our community to ensure its longevity, continuous decentralization, and circular economy.

### Organizational Design


### Tools & Resources


### Token Engineering

Since the beginning of The ALANA Project, we have been determined to continuously decentralize the project and build a token economy around it to guarantee its longevity. But we were missing three important factors, which I am listing in the chronological order we have tackled them over the past two years:

1. A cohesive branding from the former personal project to one that encapsulates and represents the community. You can find the successfully developed Branding Guidelines [here]().
2. We had to gain sufficient knowledge about the design process of a token economy. We did this by joining the Token Engineering Academy and completing most of the available modules. An example here is the [public profile of founder stellaachenbach](https://tokenengineering.net/user/6347fcfcca6f14ab120b0049/).
3. We had to establish and vote on an organizational structure that enabled fairness and equality based on contribution, not financial investment.
